# An effective hybrid search method for the quadratic knapsack problem with conflict graphs (QKPCG)
The 45 benchmark instances used in our paper titled with "An effective hybrid search method for the quadratic knapsack problem with conflict graphs" are created by Dr. Xiaochuan Shi (shixiaochuan@whu.edu.cn) and friendly provided by Dr. Isma Dahmani (dahmani.isma@gmail.com).  To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here.

The source code given in 'src' directory implements the proposed HSM method described in our paper. 

We made comparisons between HSM and some state-of-the-art methods from the following related QKPCG works:
