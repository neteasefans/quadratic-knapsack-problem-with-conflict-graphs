The 45 benchmark instances used in our draft titled with "An effective hybrid search method for the quadratic knapsack problem with conflict graphs" are created by Dr. Xiaochuan Shi (shixiaochuan@whu.edu.cn) and friendly provided by Dr. Isma Dahmani (dahmani.isma@gmail.com).  To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here.
